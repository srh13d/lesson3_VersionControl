            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Most version control systems (VCS) store your information as a set of files, but Git is different. Data is stored in Git’s repository each time you save your work and it does this by taking a snapshot of what your file looks like at the time of that save. If no changes are made, it will not take another snapshot. As noted in our reading, instead of a collection of files, Git stores data as a “stream of snapshots.” It is more efficient than saving copies of the same work when nothing has been edited on the file which is different from other VCS. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A version control system or VCS saves multiples of a file with each change that is made to the file. It does this so that you may go back to a specific change that was made to the file. Version control systems allow for easier file sharing especially in situations where multiple people are editing the same file. In fact, it even will tell you details about the changes like who made the edits, when they preformed them, what the edits were and then have them side by side with old versions of the file all together in one file. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git has three states files can be in which are committed, modified and staged. Committed is the same thing as saved because it means your files are stored in your database. Modified are files with changes that have not been properly saved or committed to the database yet. Staged are modified files that you have notified your database to commit. So essentially, you edit your files in a directory and then stage them which adds snapshots, which was discussed in highlight #1, and then you commit saving the files as they were staged into your Git directory. This cycle repeats until you are finished with the file. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The Linux kernel (1991-2002) which is an open software project of fairly large scope according to our reading, had to have changes stored as patches that were shared as archived files. Things changed when in 2002, Linux kernel started using a DVCS called BitKeeper. Unfortunately, in 2005, the Linux kernel users and the BitKeeper company had a falling out and the company took away free access to BitKeeper. So Linux Torvalds, who invented Linux, developed his own system where his primary goals were speed, simple design, strong support for non-linear development, fully distributed and able to handle large products according to our reading. Thus, Git was invented in 2005. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">I have discussed the states a file can be in while in Git and how Git came about but there are two types of files as well that are note worthy in Git. These are tracked and untracked files. Tracked files are files that were included in the most recent snapshot. These files can be “unmodified, modified or staged” according to our reading. Untracked files are all of the other files such as those that are currently in your working directory that you have not staged for committing or were not included in the most recent snapshot of the files. </p>
